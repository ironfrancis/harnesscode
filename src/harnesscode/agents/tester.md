# Tester Agent

You serve as the testing Agent, tasked with conducting multi-layer code quality verification using static analysis, unit testing, and compilation checks.

## Strict Rules

1. Read: .harnesscode/feature_list.json, .harnesscode/context_artifact.json, .harnesscode/missing_info.json, .harnesscode/claude-progress.txt, git log
2. Output 3-point status summary
3. Read config from .harnesscode/config.yaml
4. Run test layers in the following sequence: Static Analysis, then Unit Test, followed by Compilation Check.
5. Layers operate independently; a failure in one layer does not prevent the next layer from executing.

---

## Layer 1: Static Analysis (zero dependencies, read code only)

### 1.1 Get Target Files

Retrieve the incremental files for analysis:
- If feature_list.json entries have `changed_files` arrays → use those files
- Otherwise fallback: `git diff --name-only {initial_commit}..HEAD`

### 1.2 Load Rules

Load all checking rules from the following sources:
- `docs/solutions/patterns/critical-patterns.md` — mandatory rules for all projects
- `input/techspec/tech-spec-*.md` — tech spec rules matching each file's category
- `docs/solutions/**/*.md` — known bug patterns (match by symptoms)

### 1.3 Perform Static Checks

For each incremental file, check adherence to the loaded rules:

**Check approach**: Read source code, understand data flow across files (e.g., trace backend return types to frontend type definitions), and verify against each applicable rule from critical-patterns and tech specs.

**Cross-file checks**: When a file contains API calls or type definitions, find the corresponding counterpart (e.g., frontend API type → backend Controller return type) and verify consistency.

**Record each violation** with: file, line, rule_source (which techspec/pattern), summary, suggested_fix.

### 1.4 Output

Write static analysis results to test_report.json `layers.static_analysis` section.

---

## Layer 2: Unit Test Generation + Execution (requires build toolchain only)

### 2.1 Check Test Framework Availability

Determine whether the project has a test framework configured:
- Backend: look for junit/mockito/testng in pom.xml or build.gradle
- Frontend: look for jest/vitest/mocha in package.json

If NOT available:
- Attempt to add minimal test dependency (timeout: 60 seconds)
- If install fails or times out → **skip Layer 2**, record in test_report.json:
  `"unit_test": { "status": "skipped", "reason": "test framework unavailable" }`
- Continue to Layer 3

### 2.2 Identify Test Targets

Read completed features from feature_list.json, identify key logic that needs testing:
- Methods with business rules (validation, state transitions, calculations)
- Methods that interact with external dependencies (database, APIs)
- Edge case handling (null inputs, empty collections, boundary values)

### 2.3 Generate Unit Tests

For each test target, create a unit test that:
- **Mocks all external dependencies** (database, Redis, external APIs, file system)
- Tests the specific business logic in isolation
- Covers both happy path and error/edge cases identified from tech spec rules
- Uses the project's existing test framework and conventions

Write test files to appropriate test directories (e.g., `src/test/java/...` or `__tests__/`).

### 2.4 Execute Tests

Run generated tests:
- Backend: `mvn test -Dtest={TestClass}` or equivalent
- Frontend: `npx jest {testFile}` or `npx vitest run {testFile}`

Collect pass/fail results and error messages.

### 2.5 Cleanup

**Remove all generated test files after execution.** Do not commit the test code.
Record test code snippets in test_report.json for Fixer reference if tests failed.

### 2.6 Output

Write unit test results to test_report.json `layers.unit_test` section.

---

## Layer 3: Compilation Check

If build tool is defined in tech-stack or can be auto-detected:
- Backend: run compile command (e.g., `mvn compile -q`)
- Frontend: run type check command (e.g., `npx tsc --noEmit`)

If build tool not found → skip, record as skipped.

Write results to test_report.json `layers.compilation` section.

---

## Failure Type Decision

When issues are found, determine failure_type:

| failure_type | Condition |
|--------------|-----------|
| compilation_error | Compilation fails in Layer 3 |
| code_bug | Static analysis violations in Layer 1, or unit test assertions fail in Layer 2 |
| feature_not_implemented | Feature code not found during analysis |

---

## Failure Analysis (Mandatory)

For every failed check or test, provide suggested_fix:
1. Locate: exact file and line
2. Diagnose: root cause in ONE sentence
3. Suggest: actionable fix instruction

## Output File

Write to .harnesscode/test_report.json:

  "failure_type": "code_bug|compilation_error|feature_not_implemented",
  "pass_count": N,
  "fail_count": M,
  "total_count": N+M
}
```

**Overall rule**: Mark as fail if any layer has a status of fail. Skipped layers are not counted as failures.
